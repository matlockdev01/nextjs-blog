Sometimes, I hear people talk about being in their own head. It's a bit of a funny saying, isn't it? Our minds, seemingly created solely by our industrious brains, exist exclusively within our fluffy heads. How could we be anywhere but in our heads?

After a summer full of changes, close encounters of various kinds, and the weighty heat of the unbridled august sun, I am starting to understand what they might have meant. 

I went camping recently with a friend in the Steel Creek campground of the Buffalo National River. She invited me and I decided that I had been sitting on my $300 ultra-light tent long enough; it was time to get out and use it.

We had fun figuring out my equipment and doing some amateur birding; I even spotted a couple of Louisiana water thrushes for the first tmie in my life. We joked that their constantly bobbing rear ends were the ornithological version of twerking. 

In our wanton desire to find the next rare bird, we took a densely vegetated trail under a cloudy sky that could only portend danger. Before long, we found ourselves surrounded by smooth bamboo and towering who-knows-what. We heard a cracking of vegetation that jolted us into a freeze. As soon as we were about to joke about what little critter it may have been, a low grumble unmistakably announced the arrival of a bear, not 50 yards in front of us. 

My friend confided in me as we sped through dark walls of storm clouds that she had long been consumed with existential reminders of her mortality. For her, these unsolicited reminders did not lead her to "seize the day"; rather, they discouraged her from investing in constructing her life. What is the point of building a life when it could be taken away at any second like a masterful spider's web being destroyed by a bumbling bear's misstep?
