Sometimes, I hear people talk about being in their own head. It's a bit of a funny saying, isn't it? Our minds, seemingly created solely by our industrious brains, exist exclusively within our fluffy heads. How could we be anywhere but in our heads?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After a summer full of changes, close encounters of various kinds, and the weighty heat of the unbridled august sun, I am starting to understand what they might have meant. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I went camping recently with a friend in the Steel Creek campground of the Buffalo National River. She invited me and I decided that I had been sitting on my $300 ultra-light tent long enough; it was time to get out and use it.

We had fun figuring out my equipment and doing some amateur birding; I even spotted a couple of Louisiana water thrushes for the first time in my life. We joked that their constantly bobbing rear ends were the ornithological version of twerking. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In our wanton desire to find the next rare bird, we took a densely vegetated trail under a cloudy sky that could only portend danger. Before long, we found ourselves surrounded by smooth bamboo and towering who-knows-what. We heard a cracking of vegetation that jolted us into a freeze. As soon as we were about to joke about what little critter it may have been, a low grumble unmistakably announced the arrival of a bear, not 50 yards in front of us. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

For the next 2 or 3 hours, we lay silent by the Buffalo National River, not knowing what to say or think. After some time reflecting on this, it seems like our bear scare shocked me into a paralysis. On top of the fear, I experienced frustration that we were cut off from hiking further along our intended trail. The sudden stoppage of progress by a force stronger than my own discouraged and disappointed me.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Earlier on our drive over, my friend confided in me as we sped through dark walls of storm clouds that she had long been consumed with existential reminders of her mortality. For her, these unsolicited reminders did not lead her to "seize the day"; rather, they discouraged her from investing in constructing her life. What is the point of building a life when it could be taken away at any second like a masterful spider's web being destroyed by a bumbling bear's misstep?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I don't have a nice conclusion to this entry in which I reflect on the answers to continuing on through life's discouragements. As of right now, I can only reflect on how ubiquitous and numerous these types of boundaries and challenges are in our lives, and remind myself that it is these challenges that present opportunities for us to connect with each other. Reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from a Murakami novel:
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"And in that moment, he was finally able to accept it all. In the deepest recesses of his soul, Tsukuru Tazaki understood. One heart is not connected to another through harmony alone. They are, instead, linked deeply through their wounds. Pain linked to pain, fragility to fragility. There is no silence without a cry of grief, no forgiveness without bloodshed, no acceptance without a passage through acute loss. That is what lies at the root of true harmony."
