When I was studying to be a teacher, I spent several months fumbling my way through some of John Dewey's work on philosophy, aesthetics, and education. John Dewey is touted by many as one of America's premiere philosophers and educational theorists of the 20th century. As a wannabe polymath, I really wanted to understand this man and some of his biggest ideas. Most of them seemed to escape me, but one that just made sense to me was his concept of reflective practice. 

&nbsp;

Dewey wrote that reflective practice refers to "the active, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it." In more commonly understood terms, reflective practice is critical thinking about what people believe and what is claimed to be known as true. Just saying the definition aloud, one is reminded of how sorely in need our world is of leaders and followers that demonstrate such reflective practice. 

&nbsp; 

Indeed, it is not uncommon to witness two people arguing either side of a given issue heatedly accusing the other of lacking "basic critical thinking skills." Nightly news and holiday harangues froth over with the ugly attacks on the humanity of our neighbors, our friends, and our countrymen. It is almost as bizarre as it is tragic.

&nbsp;

How is it that this is such a common occurence? That's a big question with probably not a small amount of answers. Perhaps one answer is that emotion, particularly unmanaged emotion, is an enemy of critical thinking in a sense. ARguments, after all, carry heavy emotional charge. We have all witnessed someone beside themselves with powerful emotion say and do things quite contrary to sound reason. 

&nbsp;

Be that as it may, we are, as AI research extraordinaire Marvin Minsky put it, "emotion machines." It is clich√©, but we are hard-wired to experience emotion. It certainly depends on time and perspective, but our emotional capacity can make our experience as euphoric as it can agonizing. In sum, it is worth leaning into our identity as emotional beings. 

&nbsp;

I think something American society may have lost after largely shedding our religiosity is the practice of reflecting on our emotions regularly and intentionally. Whatever your views on religion, prayer and meditatino provide a real opportunity to reflect on the emotions that so heavily influence our mental and spiritual lives. Of course, tomes could be written on technology's effect on our emotional awareness and wellbeing. Regardless of the reason for it, this modern lack of "emotional reflective practice" makes its presence known, and seems to be a contributing factor to rising rates of mental health disorders and the growing polarization of political and cultural discourse. 

&nbsp;

So we need to be more in tune and caring of our emotions. How do you teach "emotional reflective practice", or "mindfulness" as the Buddhists might term it? That's a big, bad question right there. I don't know enough to write the book on that one, but I know for me writing haiku is one way of taking a step on that journey. 

&nbsp;

Haiku are short, metered poems that usually involve weather or nature imagery. This limited space combines with strict syllabic guidelines to create, for me, a sort of drawer into which I can organize my thoughts and feelings. A girl turns me down after a first date; financial pressures intensify; I squat my current bodyweight for the first time in forever. These experiences each fall into my mind like drops of rain into a still lake, releasing quick bursts of emotions in the moment, then rippling with waves of emotion indeterminately. When I write haiku, I surf the grooves of cool water my emotions create. It is only in recalling and reflecting upon my past experience and the current emotion that I can say that I am aware of myself. 

&nbsp;

Surfing those waters can often feel dangerous. Looking pain and anxiety and betrayal and feelings of inadequcy all in the face is not a coward's task. There are tsunamis and tidal waves and toxic pufferfish, from tide to tide. But choosing not to reflect on your own emotions will not extricate you from the sea that is within you. After all, our bodies are made up of 60% water. Might as well take a seat on the shore and bask in the water's reflection. Just don't forget the sunscreen.
