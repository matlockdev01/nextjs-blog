The main discord server I participate in is full of a bunch of Minecraft nerds, which I love. I get to see the ingenuity and design capabilities of some of my friends, while also witnessing the funny idiosyncracies of other friends: obsessions with cat rooms, organizational schemas, and most of all my one friend's fixation on farming. 

For myself, I find exploring and mapping out areas to be the most entertaining aspect of Minecraft. It is a cheap and easy alternative to hiking that can include discord chatting and the comfort of A/C. I love hiking, so I enjoy Minecraft insofar as it can simulate that for me. 

When hiking though, one is constantly reminded of the balance of all the ecological and biological components of nature: a squirrel chewing an acorn, leaves perking up after sipping a recently fallen rain, an osprey fishing out of a recently polluted lake. When reminded of this balance, one is soon after presented with the question of how we as humans fit into that balance. 

I recently visited a local nature center with a few small patches of grassland adjacent to it. It was marvelous to see the scissortail flycatcher in its natural biome doing its thing, and to see hear the meek cooing of northern bobwhite being rehabilitated and prepped for release into the grasslands. I was suddenly jolted when I realized that an insidious background noise had been steadily growing; it turned out to be the road noise from I-49 nearby. This oppressive and constant drone of progress and accidental death reminded me of the bounds we have put on so many natural habitats. 

When playing Minecraft, I am struck by the absence of these thoughts, the absolute lack of any road noise. The world in Minecraft is procedurally generated; in layman's terms, your Minecraft world is essentilly infinite, but is only generated in pieces based on where you are exploring and have explored. If you explore a new area, Minecraft will generate the world out ahead of you to create the illusion that this infinite world has always existed since your little Minecraft Steve was born. An interesting consequence of this procedural generation is that the ecology and biology of Minecraft also happen to be procedurally generated. 

As a result, limitless consumption of resources has no real consequence to your world in Minecraft. Hilarity ensues as players create cow or pig hell-farms 50,000 strong, packed tightly in a 20x20 block plot of land.  The resulting sonic nightmare rivals Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima. But notwithstanding the screams and bovine calls for damnation, there will be no waste to clean from your farm, no water scarcity puzzles to sort out, no extinction or migration of species due to habitat loss. The world is infinite and so are its resources! The screams of seconds-old pigs as they are forced to procreate by the wave of a magic carrot seems to drown out any of the road noise we perceive by leaving our houses and exploring nature. 

Moreover, important ecological resources such as water, precious metals, and energy and fuel sources are also infinitely procedurally generated. Whole mountains can be hollowed out of all their diamonds, coal, and redstone (a mineral that, happily, simulates electricity wherever it is placed without consuming itself or additional fuels). After this hollowing, there will be no waste or meaningful impact on the local biome. At no point does the player witness a negative consequence of consuming mass amount of resources on the environment of their Minecraft world. 

All this would seem trivial if Minecraft were just any game. But as of writing this, Minecraft is averaging around 160 million active players worldwide. Most of these players are 24 years old or younger, and up to 54% of boys 3-12 years old play Minecraft. When you couple these striking statistics with news from gaming psychology, it might make you wonder if the psychology of Minecraft could be more important than it sounds initially. One such psychological phenomena is called the Game Transfer Phenomena which has to do with "sensory-perceptual and cognitive intrusions (e.g., hallucinations and recurrent thoughts) and self-agency transient changes (e.g., automatic behaviors) related to video games." It makes one wonder about the automatic thoughts, behaviors, and attitudes that result from long-term treatment of a virtualized world as infinitely exploitable.

What are the consequences of extensive Minecraft play on the ecological attitudes and awareness of young players? How might an "ecology mode" of Minecraft affect those attitudes? Should Microsoft, who now owns Minecraft and has an enormously thorough page on their sustainability journey, be content knowing that its best selling game of all time is anathema to its sustainability ideals? Who knows, but I do know if I play Minecraft again, I'll be playing without headphones.
